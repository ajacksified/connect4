Connect 4
=========

Install: `npm install connect4 -g`

Play: `connect4`

Note: if you get a "command not found" error, make sure npm modules are in your
path.

How to Play
-----------

Enter in a row to drop in (1-7). Take turns. Whoever gets 4 in a row
(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

Additionally, you can use the folowing optional flags:

    -p [number] to adjust the number of players
    -w [number] to adjust the width
    -h [height] to adjust the height

`connect4 -p 3 -w 10 -h 8`

Meta
----

There's some silly code in here. Not meant to be serious, but rather a discussion
with other programmers for whom I made this available on the gits.
